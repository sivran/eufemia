# Issue reporting

If you discover a **security issue** in the @dnb/eufemia, please report it by sending an
email to [tobias.hoegh@dnb.no](mailto:tobias.hoegh@dnb.no). This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository. Thanks for helping out.

Other non-security related issues and features can be filed as a new issue in [Github Issues](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/issues).
